## What is a GitHub Action

A [GitHub Action is](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/learn-github-actions/understanding-github-actions) a CI/CD platform to help you _automate your build, test and deployment pipeline_ by defining relevant workflows in files within the `.github/workflows` folder.

Workflows can:
 - be triggered by relevant events on your GitHub repository
 - perform a wide variety of jobs (build, test, modify, publish etc.)
 - run in GitHub-hosted VMs (Linux, Windows, macOS) or in a self-hosted runner (on-premises, in-cloud).


## Where can I use them?

Use GitHub actions for any job that can be _automated_ (executed as a defined set of steps, in a hosted runner environment) and _triggered_ (execution is associated with a specific event or condition in the repository), for your given repo.

The [GitHub Marketplace](https://github.com/marketplace?category=&query=&type=actions&verification=) is a good place to explore examples, grouped into categories like _API Management_, _Code Quality_, _Testing_ etc. Here are some examples from different categories, to give a sense of the functionality they can support.

 - `Code Quality` - [HashiCorp's LinkChecker](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/hashicorp-s-link-checker) can automate checking for broken links in a repo.
 - `Code Review` - [Microsoft's Inclusiveness Analyzer](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/inclusiveness-analyzer) checks your repo for offensive or exclusive terms
 - `Testing` - [Microsoft's Azure Load Testing](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-load-testing) action can simulate traffic to test diverse load conditions.
 - `Publishing` - [Upload GitHub Pages Artifact](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/upload-github-pages-artifact) for preparing static assets for uploading to GitHub Pages.

## What are the core components?

The figure below gives a high-level view of a GitHub Action - effectively a **workflow** that can be automated to run based on the occurence of trigger events.

The key concepts or components to know are:
 * **Workflow** - defined in a YAML file under `.github/workflows`. | [See Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows).
 * **Triggers** - events that make a workflow run, can be internal, external, manual or sceheduled. | [See Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/events-that-trigger-workflows).
 * **Jobs** - main unit of runnable work within workflow, can be run in sequence or in parallel. | [See Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-jobs/using-jobs-in-a-workflow)
 * **Runners** - machines that run _jobs_ in a workflow, can be self-hosted or GitHub-hosted | [See Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources)

Jobs are defined by one or more `steps` where a step can be a _script_ (with executable commands) or a _reference_ (to another action)
